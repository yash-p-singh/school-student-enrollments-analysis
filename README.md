# School Student Enrollments Analysis

The Unified District Information System for Education Plus is an educational management information system under the Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education under the Government of India. They released a public dataset recording demographic data relating to nationwide school enrollments across six academic years (from 2012-13 through 2019-20).

I analyze the data to look for demographic patterns. The details of the analysis can be found in the `school-student-enrollment-analysis.ipynb` file.
